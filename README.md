## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am a security researcher and general programmer.
I specialize at C and find networking-related vulnerabilities, but also some related to overflows
I have found some vulnerabilities I may document such as:
- BasingSE (unix systems)
- RTCrank (applications with rtc implementation enabled)
- Disecurity (discord)
- Rakless (raknet, used in roblox mainly)
- Minebytes (minecraft)
